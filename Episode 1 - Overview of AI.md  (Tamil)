Introduction:
ðŸ§  What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans. Instead of just following instructions, AI systems can:

Understand language
Recognize images and sounds
Solve problems
Learn from experience

Mention how AI is now part of our daily lives (e.g., Siri, ChatGPT, YouTube recommendations).


2. Early Beginnings (1950sâ€“1970s)
Alan Turing and the Turing Test (1950).
First AI programs: solving math problems, playing chess.

3. AI Winters (1970sâ€“1990s)
Funding cuts due to slow progress.
Overpromises vs. actual capabilities.
Still, some progress in expert systems and machine learning foundations.

4. Rise of Machine Learning (1990sâ€“2010s)
Shift from rule-based systems to data-driven learning.
Introduction of neural networks and deep learning.

5. Modern AI Boom (2010sâ€“2020s)
Big Data + GPUs = Deep Learning explosion.
AI in speech, vision, translation, and recommendation systems.
Milestones: AlphaGo, GPT-3, DALLÂ·E, autonomous vehicles.

6. Agentic & Generative AI (2023â€“Now)
Rise of Agentic AI: autonomous agents that plan and act.
Generative AI: creating text, images, music, and even code.
Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Sora.
AI in education, healthcare, and creative industries.

7. Future of AI (Speculative but grounded)
AI as collaborators, not just tools.
Ethical concerns: bias, privacy, job displacement.
Tamil AI applications: storybooks, voice assistants, education.
